HalxDocs

Full-Stack Engineer · Product Builder · Systems Thinker

I design and ship production-grade software that scales.

I’m a full-stack engineer focused on building reliable, high-performance products for companies, startups, and businesses. I work end-to-end — from system design and APIs to polished user interfaces and deployment — with a strong focus on clarity, maintainability, and long-term growth.

I help teams build software that:

ships fast without accumulating technical debt

scales with users, data, and team size

feels modern, clean, and intentional
